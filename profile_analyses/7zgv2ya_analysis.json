      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 6,
      "confidence": 0.78,
      "commentary": "It reads as a night city intersection with traffic and light streaks, but the rendering leans into a miniature/tilt\u2011shift, hyper-gloss look rather than straightforward night photography. The mood is more dreamy-cinematic than observational, with heavy bloom and softened detail that undercuts realism. Subject and composition are correct, yet the overall polish feels AI-illustrative rather than camera-captured. This profile\u2019s signature shows up as warm amber highlights, teal shadows, and a luminous bokeh haze that makes scenes feel enchanted and slightly diorama-like."

      "score": 7,
      "confidence": 0.77,
      "commentary": "The skyline emerging from fog is clearly present, and the aerial vantage is plausible, but the apocalyptic sunset sky and dramatic volumetric lighting push it into fantasy matte-painting territory. Fog behavior is stylized (billowing, stage-lit) rather than meteorologically subtle. Composition works (towers piercing a fog layer), yet the mood is more epic/cinematic than photographic. The profile\u2019s hallmark is high dynamic range with molten orange-gold clouds, deep teal-grays, and painterly atmosphere that prioritizes spectacle over documentary believability."

    "Neon Rain Alley": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 7,
      "confidence": 0.74,
      "commentary": "Rain-soaked pavement with neon reflections is strongly conveyed, and the alley/street perspective fits the prompt. However, it feels like a set-piece: too cleanly composed, overly saturated, and softly glowing in a way closer to illustration than street photography. The mood is nostalgic and romantic rather than gritty nocturnal realism. The profile\u2019s signature is evident in the warm neon palette, heavy bloom, and painterly texture on walls and signage that creates a dreamy, storybook night."

      "score": 8,
      "confidence": 0.76,
      "commentary": "The subject is accurate: a forested mountain stream with rocks, clear water, and natural framing, and it convincingly reads as landscape photography. Light is idealized (golden shafts, perfect reflections) but still within fine-art landscape norms rather than pure fantasy. Composition is strong and coherent, with believable depth and water clarity. The profile\u2019s aesthetic shows as warm sunbeams, lush greens, and a velvety, slightly painterly micro-contrast that makes nature look polished and serene."

    "Coastal Wave": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 7,
      "confidence": 0.73,
      "commentary": "Waves crashing on a dark rocky shore at dusk is on-target, and the low angle adds drama consistent with seascape photography. The wave forms into an unusually sculptural curl with a glowing core, which feels more like VFX/fine-art composite than a captured moment. Mood is stormy and cinematic rather than naturalistic dusk. The profile\u2019s signature appears in the teal-and-amber grade, sparkling specular highlights, and heightened texture that pushes realism into hyperreal spectacle."
    },
    "Winter Forest Mist": {
      "affinity": "resistant",
      "score": 4,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "commentary": "The prompt asks for a snow-covered forest with fog, but the scene reads more like an autumnal forest with golden foliage and only light frosting at best. Fog/mist is present, yet the dominant mood is sunlit and warm rather than cold, muted winter atmosphere. Subject is close (forest + haze), but seasonality is a major miss. The profile\u2019s consistent look\u2014golden god-rays, warm highlights, and painterly haze\u2014overrides the required wintry palette and chill."
    },
    "Documentary Environmental Portrait": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 6,
      "confidence": 0.72,
      "commentary": "A person in a natural setting is clearly depicted, but the styling is too curated and cinematic for documentary portraiture. The intense eye emphasis, shallow depth, and lush floral framing feel staged and editorial rather than observational. Mood is intimate and surreal-romantic, not raw or candid. The profile\u2019s signature shows in the teal-green shadows, warm skin highlights, and soft, painterly bokeh that turns a portrait into an art-directed tableau."
    },
    "Vintage Drive-In": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 7,
      "confidence": 0.74,
      "commentary": "The classic car and retro drive-in/diner context reads correctly, with pleasing environmental details and a coherent automotive subject. Still, it feels like a nostalgic film set: too perfectly lit and arranged, with a soft glow that reduces the \u2018photography\u2019 bite. Mood is warm, quaint, and cinematic rather than straightforward automotive coverage. The profile\u2019s hallmark is the amber-green color grade, gentle bloom, and storybook cleanliness that makes scenes feel curated and timeless."
    },
    "Window Light Interior": {
      "affinity": "resistant",
      "score": 3,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "commentary": "It is an interior with strong natural window light, but it is not minimalist\u2014there are abundant plants, frames, and decorative elements that create a lush, cluttered composition. The mood is serene and sun-dappled, yet it reads more like an indoor conservatory set than a minimalist room. The technique leans fine-art/cinematic with glowing dust and painterly highlights, not clean architectural interior photography. The profile\u2019s signature is the verdant overgrowth, warm sunbeams, and soft haze that consistently romanticizes spaces."
    },
    "Motion Blur Abstract": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 5,
      "confidence": 0.71,
      "commentary": "There is a grocery-aisle-like environment and a sense of motion blur, but the scene becomes a glittering, bokeh-filled fantasy rather than an abstract photographic study of movement. The blur is present yet overwhelmed by stylized light particles and excessive glow that don\u2019t read as real aisle lighting. Mood is magical/cinematic instead of mundane-abstract. The profile\u2019s signature is strongest here: teal/orange grading, heavy bloom, and sparkling specular \u2018dust\u2019 that turns everyday scenes into luminous spectacle."
    },
    "Documentary Portrait Test": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 6,
      "confidence": 0.74,
      "commentary": "An elderly fisherman close-up is clearly depicted, and the environment suggests a working context, but the image is too polished and color-sculpted to feel like 35mm documentary. Skin texture and lighting read more like high-end digital portraiture with cinematic grading than film grain realism. Mood is dramatic and heroic rather than candid. The profile\u2019s signature appears in the warm amber practical lights, teal-blue background tones, and creamy depth-of-field that aestheticizes the subject."
    },
    "Fine Art Landscape Test": {
      "affinity": "native_fit",
      "score": 8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "commentary": "As fine art landscape photography of a forest, it succeeds: layered foliage, controlled light rays, and a composed foreground path create a gallery-ready scene. It is idealized and slightly painterly, but that aligns with \u2018fine art\u2019 expectations rather than breaking medium. Color is rich and intentionally balanced, with strong subject separation and atmosphere. The profile\u2019s signature is the luminous god-rays, saturated florals/greens, and soft, velvety contrast that makes nature feel curated and romantic."
    },
    "Commercial Product Test": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 7,
      "confidence": 0.76,
      "commentary": "The whiskey glass with ice is clear and appetizing, with strong specular highlights and a commercial macro feel. However, the scene is over-embellished with glittering particles/spark bursts that push it toward stylized advertising fantasy rather than standard product photography. Mood is celebratory and cinematic, not cleanly controlled studio realism. The profile\u2019s signature shows in the teal-and-gold palette, high sparkle/bloom, and hyper-detailed liquid/ice rendering."
    },
    "Street Test - Woman in Tokyo": {
      "affinity": "resistant",
      "score": 3,
      "confidence": 0.78,
      "commentary": "It depicts a woman in an urban setting, but it does not feel candid street photography\u2014she is centered, sharply lit, and posed like an editorial portrait with background extras. Tokyo is only loosely implied; the scene reads more like a styled market/festival with decorative lights than a specific street moment. Mood is glamorous and cinematic rather than spontaneous and observational. The profile\u2019s signature is prominent: warm golden bokeh, teal shadows, and a polished, portrait-forward look that overrides the candid requirement."
    },
    "Architecture Test": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 7,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "commentary": "A modern office building against a stormy sky is accurately presented, with strong geometric forms and a suitably moody atmosphere. The image leans into cinematic concept-architecture: glowing interiors, misty surroundings, and a slightly surreal, pristine rendering that feels more like visualization than strict architectural photography. Composition is solid and the storm mood reads, but realism is softened by bloom and painterly lighting. The profile\u2019s signature appears in the teal-gray storm palette contrasted with warm amber window light and glossy, high-drama tonal mapping."
    },
    "Food Test": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 6,
      "confidence": 0.78,
      "commentary": "The subject reads clearly as ramen on a wooden table, but it drifts from straightforward food photography into a stylized still-life with heavy art-direction and painterly micro-contrast. Lighting feels like golden, cinematic window light with pronounced bloom and texture enhancement rather than a natural photographic capture. The profile signature shows up as lush, warm color grading (amber/green), ornate props (flowers, ceramics), and a slightly hyperreal, illustrative sharpness that prioritizes atmosphere over realism."
    },
    "Sports Test": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 5,
      "confidence": 0.74,
      "commentary": "It depicts two female soccer players contesting the ball, but the image reads more like a cinematic action poster than sports photography. The extreme bokeh, glowing particle-like highlights, and dramatic grading push it into fantasy realism rather than a credible sideline shot. The profile\u2019s hallmark is the warm, fiery palette with glittering highlights and a soft, painterly haze that beautifies motion at the expense of documentary authenticity."
    },
    "Fashion Test": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 7,
      "confidence": 0.77,
      "commentary": "A model in a desert is present and the styling is fashion-forward, but the dress becomes an exaggerated, sculptural floral plume that feels more like concept art than fashion photography. The atmosphere is grand and editorial with dramatic clouds and a highly controlled, cinematic light. The profile leans into opulent textures, creamy highlights, and warm-gold tones, producing a romantic, painterly editorial look rather than a believable shoot."
    },
    "Wildlife Test": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 7,
      "confidence": 0.76,
      "commentary": "The lioness (or young lion) is centered and looking at the camera, satisfying the core subject, but the scene feels too curated and storybook to pass as wildlife photography. Foreground flowers, heavy haze, and glowing backlight create a dreamy tableau rather than a natural savannah encounter. The profile signature is evident in the warm backlit bloom, saturated earth tones, and painterly depth-of-field that romanticizes the animal."
    },
    "Cyberpunk Digital": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 6,
      "confidence": 0.73,
      "commentary": "A lone figure in a neon-lit city is present, but the cyberpunk edge is softened by an impressionistic, rainy-street nostalgia rather than sharp, high-tech grit. Neon signage and reflections help, yet the palette skews warm-gold/teal with painterly diffusion instead of hard, graphic sci-fi contrast. The profile\u2019s consistent look appears as atmospheric haze, textured brush-like rendering, and cinematic glow that turns cyberpunk into poetic urban mood."
    },
    "Abstract Expressionism": {
      "affinity": "resistant",
      "score": 3,
      "confidence": 0.82,
      "commentary": "The prompt calls for bold gestural abstraction, but the image retains recognizable faces and floral forms, reading as surreal figurative painting rather than abstract expressionism. Brushwork is lush and impasto-like, yet it\u2019s used to model subjects, not to create non-representational gesture and color-field tension. The profile signature is a dreamy, oil-like smear with soft-focus transitions and jewel-toned highlights, prioritizing romantic figuration over true abstraction."
    },
    "Minimalist Gradient Painting": {
      "affinity": "resistant",
      "score": 2,
      "confidence": 0.86,
      "commentary": "This is not minimalist: it\u2019s a highly detailed, dramatic seascape/sky with complex clouds, waves, and volumetric lighting. The gradient exists, but it\u2019s embedded in a maximal, painterly fantasy environment rather than a simple suggestion of landscape. The profile\u2019s hallmark shows as saturated sunset colors (cyan-magenta-gold), soft bloom, and ornate texture that strongly resists minimalism."
    },
    "3D Render Concept": {
      "affinity": "native_fit",
      "score": 8,
      "confidence": 0.77,
      "commentary": "The scene convincingly reads as a 3D-rendered futuristic vehicle/architecture in a glassy, vaulted environment, with plausible materials and reflections. Lighting is cinematic and warm, with strong specular highlights and a polished, high-end visualization feel. The profile\u2019s signature appears in the gilded palette, lush environmental dressing (plants, lamps), and a romantic, slightly storybook opulence layered onto the sci-fi design."
    },
    "Pop Surrealism Portrait": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 7,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "commentary": "The portrait is reality-bending with unexpected mechanical/toy-like elements and a stylized, glossy finish, aligning well with pop surrealism. However, it leans toward pristine, high-fashion digital painting rather than the more subversive, graphic weirdness often associated with the genre. The profile signature is smooth skin rendering, high clarity, pastel-to-jewel accents, and a curated collage of ornate objects that feels luxurious and controlled."
    },
    "Whimsical Illustration - Fantasy Character": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 6,
      "confidence": 0.72,
      "commentary": "The scene is whimsical and fantastical in scale and props, but the 'character' presence is minimal and not especially playful in expression or action. It reads more like a meticulously rendered fantasy still-life environment than a character-driven illustration. The profile\u2019s aesthetic shows as lush, tactile detail, warm-gold highlights, and a dreamy, painterly realism that can dampen cartoonish whimsy."
    },
    "Children's Book Illustration Test": {
      "affinity": "resistant",
      "score": 4,
      "confidence": 0.83,
      "commentary": "While a cat and tea set in a garden-like setting are present, the cat is not clearly drinking tea, and the scene feels like a moody still-life rather than an active children\u2019s book moment. The requested ink-and-watercolor look is compromised by dense, oil-like shading and cinematic lighting with heavy texture. The profile signature is dark, mossy greens with warm accents and a painterly, antique realism that clashes with light, readable children\u2019s illustration."
    },
    "Abstract Test - Oil and Brushstrokes": {
      "affinity": "resistant",
      "score": 3,
      "confidence": 0.81,
      "commentary": "Despite some smeared paint textures, the image remains strongly figurative (multiple faces, flowers) and reads as dreamy narrative art rather than abstract expressionist shapes and brushstrokes. The composition is cinematic and layered like a film still behind fogged glass, not an exploration of pure form. The profile\u2019s signature is soft-focus oil haze, cool-teal shadows with warm copper highlights, and romantic, ghosted figures overriding abstraction."
    },
    "Digital Concept Art - Futuristic Airborne City": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 7,
      "confidence": 0.74,
      "commentary": "It conveys a futuristic city with floating/airborne architectural pods and grand terraces, which fits the concept art brief. However, it skews more toward ornate solarpunk fantasy architecture than a clearly engineered airborne metropolis, with a very polished, idyllic mood. The profile\u2019s signature is luminous gold-and-teal grading, intricate filigree-like structures, and a painterly gloss that romanticizes sci-fi into elegant fantasy."
    },
    "Charcoal Sketch Test": {
      "affinity": "resistant",
      "score": 3,
      "confidence": 0.84,
      "commentary": "The mood is melancholy and there is some textured overlay, but it is not a true black-and-white charcoal sketch; it\u2019s a mixed-media digital painting with color, collage text, and photographic-like rendering. Charcoal mark-making and paper grain are secondary to soft, painterly shading and composited elements. The profile\u2019s signature is moody teal-gray toning, cinematic softness, and ornamental layering that undermines the strict charcoal requirement."
    },
    "Vector/Logo Test": {
      "affinity": "resistant",
      "score": 1,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "commentary": "This completely misses the flat vector/logo requirement: it is a highly detailed, dimensional, painterly fox portrait with translucent floral forms. There are no clean geometric shapes, flat fills, or icon-like simplification typical of vector marks. The profile signature is evident in the lush, luminous warm palette, soft depth, and decorative organic textures\u2014essentially the opposite of logo minimalism."
    },
    "Graphic Novel - Noir Anime Steampunk": {
      "affinity": "resistant",
      "score": 3,
      "confidence": 0.78,
      "commentary": "The image leans into ornate steampunk worldbuilding, but it misses both \u201cnoir\u201d and \u201cgraphic novel/anime\u201d execution: lighting is bright, golden, and romantic rather than shadowy and high-contrast, and the rendering is painterly-cinematic instead of inked linework/cel shading. The subject reads as a lavish Victorian fantasy plaza with balloons and gilded architecture, not a noir scene with dramatic chiaroscuro or gritty atmosphere. Style-wise, the profile strongly favors warm amber highlights, soft atmospheric haze, and hyper-detailed decorative textures that push toward storybook concept art rather than comic/anime aesthetics."
    },
    "Watercolor Painting - Rose Garden": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 6,
      "confidence": 0.74,
      "commentary": "It depicts a rose garden convincingly in subject matter and overall mood, with a soft, botanical still-life sensibility. However, the medium reads more like polished oil/digital painting than watercolor: edges are too controlled, highlights are creamy, and there\u2019s limited evidence of translucent washes, blooms, or paper granulation. The palette is lush and muted (sage greens, blush pinks, deep burgundy) with a velvety depth that feels layered and varnished rather than watery. The profile signature shows in the cinematic bokeh-like background and meticulous petal modeling that prioritizes realism over watercolor spontaneity."
    },
    "Pop Art Test - Mixed Media Collage": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 7,
      "confidence": 0.77,
      "commentary": "The woman with sunglasses is clear and central, and there are some collage cues (floating graphic circles, text fragments) that nod toward mixed media. Still, it doesn\u2019t fully commit to Pop Art language: halftone dots and cut-paper layering are subtle-to-absent, and the image reads primarily as a glossy retro-futurist photo-illustration rather than a flat, punchy, screenprint-like collage. Color is saturated but controlled (teal, red-orange lips, warm cream skin), with a slick airbrushed finish. The profile\u2019s aesthetic leans toward cinematic polish, soft glow, and high-end editorial styling, which dilutes the raw, tactile cut-and-paste Pop Art feel."
    },
    "Impressionist Oil Painting Test": {
      "affinity": "workable",
      "score": 6,
      "confidence": 0.72,
      "commentary": "The countryside landscape subject is on-target, with a tranquil river, grasses, and trees arranged in a classical pastoral composition. The technique, however, is closer to detailed realism/digital plein-air than true Impressionism: brushwork is too smooth, forms are too resolved, and there\u2019s limited broken color or visible impasto. Lighting is warm and golden with dramatic clouds, giving it a romantic, cinematic tone rather than a fleeting observational impression. The profile\u2019s signature shows in the high dynamic range glow, crisp textural detailing in foliage, and a polished finish that resists the looser, more optical Impressionist approach."
